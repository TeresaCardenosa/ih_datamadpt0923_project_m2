# Data Climbing ðŸ§—

The Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games marked a turning point for the sport of climbing, making it an Olympic sport for the first time. 
Since then, climbing has been enjoying a boom, with more and more fans joining the sport. But what is the average climber's profile? 

In this repository we will visualise the anthropometric factors of the standard climber. In addition, we standardise the degrees of ascent and difficulty in order to visualise the height and weight of climbers who reach elite and higher elite levels.

## Dataset

For the visualisation we will use the 'Climb Dataset' shared by Jordi Zaragoza on Kaggle.

ðŸ”— https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jordizar/climb-dataset ðŸ”—

This dataset contains three tables, of which we will make one of two:

1âƒ£ Grading table: grades_conversion_table.csv 

Contains the numerical conversion of the grade_id towards the level standardisation in France.

2âƒ£ Climbers table: climber_df.csv 

It contains information on climbers. The data that are of interest for this project are:  
- Climber identifier
- Sex of the climber 
- Height of climber 
- Weight 
- Maximum ascent grade reached 
- Years of climbing training


## Technologies ðŸ’»

EDA and Analysis: 

- Python version 3.10.13
- Pandas

Visualization:
 
- Tableau Public 2023.3

## Main conclusions 

These are the main conclusions of the EDA and the visualisation: 

ðŸ‘‰ **Climbing, a sport for adults**. 

The average age of the climber is 33 years old. Although we recorded younger climbers (under 20), the bulk of the data set is concentrated between the ages of 30 and 35. We even found a higher number of climbers in their 40s compared to climbers in their 20s. 

ðŸ‘‰ **Mostly male sport**. 

In our dataset we found that 87% of climbers are male, compared to less than 13% of female climbers. 

ðŸ‘‰ **1,76m height and 67,6kg average weight**.

In our dataset we have people with a minimum height of 1.37m and a minimum weight of 40kg, as well as a maximum height of 2.02m and a maximum weight of 93kg. 

ðŸ‘‰ **Climbing, a sport that gets you hooked**.

The climbers we know of have been climbing for an average of 12 years. The minimum time is one year and the maximum 29 years, although it is true that the bulk of our data is between the 50% and 75% quartile. 




## Draw your own conclusions

I invite you to visit the final visualisation published on [Tableau Public - Data Climbing](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/teresa.carde.osa/viz/project2_data_climbing/Historia1?publish=yes) in order to draw your own conclusions. 

I'd love to hear from you! If you want, you can also get in touch via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mteresacardenosadeheras/).
